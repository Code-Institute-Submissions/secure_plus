## Testing User Stories
---

1. As a multinational corporation with over 1000 staff cyber security is very important to us. I found this website quite easy to navigate, I like that they have a lot of the services offered but I think the main thing that stands out for me is they have an option to click a contact page and contact them about any other services I might need so they can tailor a package to my needs. I will requite this with so many staff.

    * Happy to have the option to contact about services offered outside the main packages.
    * Website is easy to navigate.

2. As a small business owner I am not very computer literate and I want somebody to help me with everything about internet security as a lot of business is online these days. I have recently had a huge issue with a virus in the IT infrastructure of my business, I want to be able to go on here and have a complete overhaul. I see they have a package here for a comprehensive check of our systems, this is exactly what I need.

    * Website has a package specific to my needs which I like.
    * The comprehensive package is also a bonus for somebody like myself who is not computer literate.

3. As a graphic designer I do all of my work on my laptop and I want to ensure I am protected against any cyber threats because if something happens with this laptop I will be unable to work. Money is tight, a lot of companies don't display prices for this type of thing without contacting them first. I want to be able to see prices before approaching the company, this website has 3 main prices displayed and I think I will go for the monthly option.
    
    * The fact I can see the price options before applying is great, other companies dont usually offer this.
    * I would like to be able to sign up though and have no correspondance afterwards.

4. As a student I want to have some sort of protection against cyber threats on my laptop to protect my work. I want a full list of all benefits and everything completely laid out when I look throuzÂ§gh this site. Upon searching through services I can see they have some of the main benefits noted down but not all as this is more geared towards commercial entities and it looks like they will contact you after to get everything set up. This site is not for me as I am not a commercial business.
   
    * This site doesn't appeak to me as I can't see a full list of every benefit in each package.
    * This product doesnt appeal to me as it's geared toward companies as opposed to the average consumer.

5. As a business owner just starting out costs are tight at the moment and it would suit me to have an option to pay on a short term basis. When searching for costs I see they have a monthly option which suits me and I will go for this.
   
    * I like the fact they have a lower cost option for my business as I am just starting out and costs are tight.
    * It is quite easy to complete the purchase and enter in my details to get started.
